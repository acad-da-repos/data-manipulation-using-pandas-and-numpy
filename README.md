# Pandas and NumPy Data Manipulation Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will practice fundamental data manipulation techniques using Pandas and NumPy. You will be working with a simple dataset and performing tasks such as selecting data, filtering, and creating new columns.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find a function definition: `manipulate_data(df)`.
3.  Your task is to perform the following operations on the input DataFrame `df`:
    *   Select the 'Name' and 'Age' columns.
    *   Filter the data to include only individuals older than 30.
    *   Create a new column called 'Age_in_Months' which is the 'Age' multiplied by 12.
4.  The function should return the resulting DataFrame.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How would you calculate the average age of the individuals in the original dataset?
*   Can you sort the final DataFrame by 'Age' in descending order?
*   Explore other NumPy functions that can be applied to the 'Age' column.
